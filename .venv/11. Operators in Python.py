# Arithmetic operators
# '+' for addition
# '-' for subtraction
# '*' for multiplication
# '/' for division
# '//' for floor division, works exactly like the least integer function [x]
# '**' for exponentiation (raising a number by a certain power)
# '%' for modulo operation (finding the remainder on dividing two integers)

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
# 1. Simple Assignment ( = )
# 2. Add and Assign ( += )
# 3. Subtract and Assign ( -= )
# 4. Multiply and Assign ( *= )
# 5. Divide and Assign ( /= )

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
# Compare values and return boolean ( True, False )
# 1. Equal to ( == )
# 2. Not Equal to ( != )
# 3. Greater than ( > )
# 4. Greater than ( < )
# 5. Greater than or Equal to ( >= )
# 6. Less than or Equal to ( <= )

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# 1. and : Returns True if both operands are True
# 2. or : Returns True if at least one of the operands are True
# 3. not : Returns the opposite Boolean value

print("5 == 6 is", 5 == 6)
print("4 + 3 != 7 is", 4 + 3 != 7)
print("-1 > 0 is", -1 > 0)
print(1.0 == 1)

print(2 == 2 and 3 == 4)
print(3/3 == 1 and 4/3 != 1)
print(2/4 == 0.5 or 3/4 == 1)
print(not 3/3 == 1)
